Rotation of a 2d array: Nitisha

Byteman has a collection of N squares with side 1. How many different rectangles can he form using these squares? Two rectangles are considered different if none of them can be rotated and moved to obtain the second one. During rectangle construction, Byteman can neither deform the squares nor put any squares upon any other ones.

1.A little girl counts from 1 to 1000 using the fingers of her left hand asfollows. She starts by calling her thumb 1, the first finger 2, middle finger 3,ring finger 4, and little finger 5.

Every genuine coin weighs 10 grams, and every fake weighs 11grams. You have an analytical scale that can determine the exact weight ofany number of coins. What is the minimum number of weighings neededto identify the stack with the fake coins?

3.Is it possible to tile an 8 × 8 board with dominoes (2 × 1 tiles) so that notwo dominoes form a 2 × 2 square?

4.The squares of an 8×8 chessboard are mistakenly colored in blocks of twocolors as shown in Figure 2.4.
